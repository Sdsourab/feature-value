## Analysis of Results

### 1. **Future Pricing Analysis**
The tool calculates the expected future price of an asset using the following formula:

\[
\text{Future Price} = \text{Current Price} \times e^{(\mu - \frac{1}{2}\sigma^2) \times T}
\]

Where:
- \(\mu\) = Expected annual growth rate
- \(\sigma\) = Volatility
- \(T\) = Time horizon (in years)

#### Key Metrics:
- **Expected Future Price**: The projected value of the asset after the specified time horizon.
- **95% Confidence Interval**: A range within which the future price is expected to fall with 95% probability.
- **Value at Risk (VaR)**: The maximum potential loss at a 95% confidence level.
- **Sharpe Ratio**: A measure of risk-adjusted return, calculated as:

\[
\text{Sharpe Ratio} = \frac{\text{Expected Return} - \text{Risk-Free Rate}}{\text{Volatility}}
\]

### 2. **Portfolio Optimization**
The portfolio optimizer uses a quantum-inspired algorithm to determine the optimal asset allocation. It visualizes the **efficient frontier**, which represents the set of portfolios that offer the highest expected return for a given level of risk.

#### Key Features:
- **Dynamic Allocation**: Adjust asset weights using sliders to see how the portfolio's risk and return change.
- **Efficient Frontier**: A scatter plot showing the optimal portfolios based on risk and return.

## formula 
$$
\text{Future Price} = \text{Current Price} \times e^{(\mu - \frac{1}{2}\sigma^2) \times T}
$$

$$
\text{Sharpe Ratio} = \frac{\text{Expected Return} - \text{Risk-Free Rate}}{\text{Volatility}}
$$

$$
\text{Lower Bound} = \text{Future Price} \times e^{-1.96 \times \sigma \times \sqrt{T}}
$$

$$
\text{Upper Bound} = \text{Future Price} \times e^{1.96 \times \sigma \times \sqrt{T}}
$$

$$
\text{VaR} = \text{Future Price} - \text{Lower Bound}
$$
